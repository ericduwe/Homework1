The following changes have been made to make the Horiseon website to make the page more accessible:
- Refactored code to replace various divs and replace them with the following:
    - < header >
    - < nav >
    - < figure >
    - < main >
    - < article >
    - < aside >
    - < footer >
 - Changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Marketing"
 - Added descriptive alt text to every image element
 - Condensed < h1 > text in header so that "Horiseon" isn't broken up and screen-readers can read it
 - Fixed HTML indentation for better flow and readability
 
 
 NOTE: Left background image in css file instead of adding to HTML; determined that it wasn't presenting useful information that required alt text
