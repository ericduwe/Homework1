## **Homework1: Semantic HTML and Webpage Accessibility**

### **Project Description:**

The following changes have been made to the Horiseon website code to make the page more accessible:

- Refactored code to eliminate most divs and replace them with the following semantic HTML elements:
  - < header >
  - < nav >
  - < figure >
  - < figcaption >
  - < main >
  - < article >
  - < aside >
  - < footer >
- Changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Marketing"
- Added descriptive alt text to every image element
- Condensed < h1 > text in header so that "Horiseon" isn't broken up and screen-readers can read it easily
- Eliminated any redundant or unnecessary class and id tags for better readability
- Eliminated CSS  class or id selectors with identical sets of rules and condensed them into single element selectors
- Improved HTML indentation for better flow and readability
- Added comments to CSS to explain styling rules
